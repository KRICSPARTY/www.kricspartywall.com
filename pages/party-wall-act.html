                Party Wall Agreement is a <b>legal requirement</b> which is typically required when one property owner plans to
                carry out construction or renovation work that may affect a shared wall, boundary, or structure. The term "party
                wall" generally refers to a wall or structure that separates two or more properties, such as a wall in a
                semi-detached house, a terrace, or a boundary wall between two properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the England and Wales, the party wall agreements are governed by the <b>Party Wall etc. Act 1996</b>. This
                act provides a framework for resolving disputes and ensuring that both parties are protected when work is done on a
                party wall or near a shared boundary. The agreement helps prevent disputes over damage or disruption caused by the
                work and ensures that both parties are aware of their rights and obligations.

            <h4 class="pb-0">Key Steps in the Party Wall Process:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Serving Notice:</b> The party proposing the work must serve a formal notice to the adjoining property
                    owner(s) at least two months before the work starts. This notice will describe the planned work and may
                    include detailed plans and diagrams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Consent or Disagreement:</b> The adjoining owner has the right to consent or object to the proposed
                    works. If the adjoining owner disagrees, a surveyor may be appointed to mediate the dispute.
                    <br />
                    This can be one common surveyor (an Agreed Surveyor) who will represent both the parties impartially. Or
                    both the parties can appoint the surveyor of their choice. In some cases, a third surveyor may
                    be appointed to act impartially.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Schedule of Condition:</b> Once the surveyor(s) is appointed, the next step is to visit the adjoining
                    owner&apos;s property to prepare a Schedule of Condition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Party Wall Award:</b> the surveyors then draft a <b>Party Wall Award</b>, which outlines how the work should be
                    carried out, ensuring that both parties are protected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Dispute resolution:</b> Under the party wall agreement, dispute resolution is a critical component of
                    the process. The appointed surveyor(s) ensures that any conflicts between adjoining property owners are
                    handled fairly and effectively.
